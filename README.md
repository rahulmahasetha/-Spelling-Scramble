# -Spelling-Scramble
## ‚ú® Project Overview

"Spelling Scramble" is an engaging and interactive mobile game designed to enhance vocabulary acquisition and spelling proficiency through gamified challenges. Built with Flutter, this application transforms traditional spelling drills into a dynamic, round-based experience where players must construct valid English words from scrambled letters, adhering to a unique "fixed letter" constraint. It provides immediate feedback, adaptive difficulty, and a fun, competitive environment to foster intrinsic motivation for language learning.
